# Front End Testing  

## Unit Testing
Unit tests ensure that individual components of the app work as expected. Assertions test the component API.  (quality of ingredients using cooking analogy)

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!


## Functional Testing
ensure that the app works as expected from the user’s perspective. Assertions primarily test the user interface.

(food doesn't taste like crap using cooking analogy)

## Integration Testing
ensure that component collaborations work as expected. Assertions may test component API, UI, or side-effects (such as database I/O, logging, etc…)
